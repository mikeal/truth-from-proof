# What is Truth from Proof

As long as we've recorded our history it contains a common theme of human beings searching for a source of truth.

Most religions are founded on a person having or at least having claimed to receive their truth from "God" or some other divine source. As each religion has a slightly different collection of sources it considers "authentic" no consensus could ever emerge about truth from this method.

Some say they follow "science" it this regard. They look to science as a source of truth, and whatever they can be convinced is "scientific" they then believe to be true. The scientific method is not an authenticator of truth in-and-of-itself, but rather a method for discovering truth. Among the sciences, a great divide can be seen between discplines which have obstained forms of proof and those which have not.

English is the language this is written in. As a language, English doesn't present much in the way of "proof." It's a highly subjective language that is constantly changing. It's not a good source of truth.

Math is also a language. It's a language we humans developed in observation of the natural world. As such, it has rules we observed in the natural world for which we don't actually have complete proof. Nature is full of paradoxes, things we can observe with consistency but can't actually prove or explain.

When we rely upon deterministic behavior in a language like mathemetics, we can create forms of proof that any one that understands the same language (math) will agree with. This puts math, and any other language that can present proof, in a completely different position from religion, most science, or natural language.

Today, off-the-shelf crytographic functions are available in any computing environment. The distribution and ease of use of these functions means that we can create proofs without the need to understand formal mathematics. In fact, if we treat these as pure functions rather than implementatations of specific mathemetical algorithms, we can create proofs that remain usable as the underlying cryptographic algorithms change.

This allows us to easily build systems and applications that can talk to each other and agree about truth without intermediaries.

This book, and the methods within, are not most useful in create new "second systems" as most of what is called "crypto" today is. These methods work in any environment, including environments where data and compute already live. Just because our data and idenities live in locations or among providers we don't control doesn't mean we can't have truth from proof. As long as we can "see" it, we can have truth from proof.

## What is Truth

Truth is trust and trust is truth. Trust is the belief that something is true. Truth is the belief that something is true. When we say we "know" or "belive" something, we are saying we trust it to be true.

What we have trusted in the past informs what we will trust in the future. The moment we accept something as true, we are trusting it. The moment we trust something, we are accepting it as true.

We may like to think that we maintain a list of things we trust and things we don't trust, but the reality is that we aren't even making conscious decisions about what we trust most of the time, we're simply accepting whatever seems to look like things we've trusted in the past.

## What is Proof

What separated from Heisenberg, Einstein, and Gödel from most philosphers and theorists was that they had at their disposal methods of proof well understood and accepted within their discipline. This meant they could go well beyond what most philosphers and theorists could do.

Rather than simply making a claim and then arguing about it, they could make a claim and then prove it. This is the difference between truth and proof. Truth is trust. Proof is trust that can be verified.

They used this to demonstrate universal theories and principles that could be applied to everything but only proven within the confines of their discipline. This is the power and the limitation of proof.

Gödel's incompleteness theorems are about more than just math. They are about the limitations of proof.

Einstein's theory of relativity is about more than just physics. It's about what physics, and all things, are relative to.

Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is about more than just quantum mechanics. It's about the limitations of what we can know as individuated beings.

In the case of these men, all three of them Jewish, the dominant institutions of their time were not opening their doors to these big ideas. But proof is proof, it can't be denied. And so each of these men were invited into the institutions they had been excluded from because if they hadn't been those insitutions would no longer be considered authorities in their discipline.

Due to the availability of modern cryptography, we all have access to the power of proof. We can demonstrate the universal in the specific, the relative in the absolute, and the limitations of what we can know as individuated beings, if we're willing to take it far enough.

## What is Truth that depends on Proof

Truth that depends on Proof is something we can do with computers and mathematics and even AI that we couldn't do with humans. What we build with computers and AI doesn't need to have the same flaw we do, of simply trust things that look like things we've trusted in the past. We can build systems that don't trust what can't be proven.

In fact, we're already doing it. Most distributed systems today rely on cryptography to establish trust between parties, and form agreements about state or form consensus. These are forms of truth that depend on proof.

The programming languages we have today, under the hood, have authenticatable data structures used for most common data structure operations like hash tables, linked lists, and trees. These are forms of truth that depend on proof, and they are primarily used here strictly for performance reasons.
