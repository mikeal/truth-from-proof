# About

This book should give any reader a good understanding of the principles of modern cryptography and how they can be applied.

No prior programming knowledge is necessary, and you won't find much math in this book so no need for prior experience there either.

This book comes out of the heavy application of cryptography "in practice." It is born from practice and is intended to be used in practice. Therefor, you won't find an acedemic treatment of the subject.

There is some code, but it's illustrative and not intended to be used in production systems. The code is written in Lisp, but as Lisp was used for many years as a general expression language anyone should find it readable and a small introduction to the language is included when code is presented. Some readers still may have difficult understanding the code, but that's okay. The code is not the point of this book, it's only an illustration.

If you want code, you can feed this book to ChatGPT or another AI and get code in whatever language you wish. This book is maintained in markdown format is available under an open license. Feel free to feed it into your favorite AI, that's what I do with it.

Rather than bore you with a long introduction, let's get started. There are appendixes covering more background on the author and the work if you are interested.
